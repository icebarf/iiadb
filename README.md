# IIADB

IIADB is a discord bot. Its a minimal bot written in the C Programming Language using [liborca](https://github.com/cee-studio/orca).

The bot increments over the `myBot/` structure provided by orca in their [building your first bot](https://github.com/cee-studio/orca/blob/master/docs/BUILDING_A_BOT.md)

Kudos to them for making such an awesome API.

Read their documentation on how to use this bot.
